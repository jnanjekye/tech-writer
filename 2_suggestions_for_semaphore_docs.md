**Task**

Review semaphoreci.com/docs and list 5 things you would improve first, explain why and outline a plan for action

**Response**

From my analysis of semaphoreci.com/docs, most of the things I would change point to the ability to easily access the documentation by the person browsing this URL. The following are my suggestions on what I would improve.

1. Categorize the documentation further to fewer categories.

When we reduce the number of decisions a person makes, then it is convinient and provides for easy access to our documentation for the readers. 

Therefore, the action is to avail a menu on top of the page with links to each of the the categories(maximum six of them) for more easy access. These links should point to relevant documentation under the category.

2. Create a button to list all existing document categories.

We currently have a side panel with many links of categories of documentation. To access the documenttion under these categories you click the category to expand so that you view the documents under the category. This can stay but we have to know it is not very convinient to the reader.

Action is to introduce a button named "Browse Docs" somewhere on the semaphore/docs URL. When clicked, it should list all the categories and the associated documentaton under them so that to the user, it is now a scroll and click business which is simpler than expanding each category he/she wants.

3. Provide a button on each document for a reader to open a github issue.

I know that the semaphore/docs is an opensource project on github. it is open source because we want feedback from the community as the authors agree they are not perfect.

Action is let us introduce a button that points to creating an issue on the github repository for the semaphore/docs project. These issues can then be handled my the community.

4. Provide a button on each document for a reader to suggest an edit.

This is a typical pull request to the semaphore/docs project on Github because again even authors make mistakes and are prone to correction.

Similar to creating issues, If a reader wants to submit an edit, let us avail a button that will point to creating a pull request on the semaphore/docs github repository. This particular one requires some validations like the person should have forked the repository.

5. Categorize the documentation depending on the person e.g Contibutor and user.

Now the people accessing the semaphore documentation are of majorly two types . They are either users of semaphore who want information on how to use semaphore or contributors to semaphore infrastructure in the form of opensource tools or any other technical contribution.

Action is to provide two buttons User and Contributor and show relevant documentation relevant to each of the users depending on what is clicked. 

**Conclusion**

The above suggestions have worked somewhere else as kubernetes has employed some of the above techniques and I find the documentation there much more easy to find. We may just need to brainstorm how the above should best be implemented on the site.

Also the action points may require technical skills but again if things are opensource then someone can always pick up a task to work on and close it.
