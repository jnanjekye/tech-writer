# Book Review : The Rails Testing Handbook by Semaphore

I had the opportunity to read a recent free ebook "The Rails Testing Handbook" by Semaphore and needless to say the content in the book is as elaborate as the title claims. The most interesting part of the book is the fact that the lessons shared are drawn from practical experiences of the semaphore team. Drawing from the challenges they faced before adopting TDD to when they evolved in their development to better appreciate the practice. Therefore many teams working with the rails stack will very much relate with this experience.

## Target Audience

This book will appeal or rather be very beneficial for ruby on rails developers that want to know how to implement maintainableand sustainable rails applications and developers that have never known why test driven development is important when implementing projects. This book sells you the why we all need to practice TDD and the how to achieve the same when developing ruby on rails applications.

Inline with this, the content is explained in a very basic way but a good understanding of ruby and ruby on rails is handy as the book does not explain every nity grity of how to get started with ruby in rails. The reader should be confortable with the rails workflow.

## Major Themes

The book explains in detail about ;

+ Why we need to practice Test first Development. Relating to the waterflow model, the authors emphasize why test first development is informs design of projects thereby increasing productivity because then teams do not get tempted to over engineer.
+ How to do BDD with Ruby on rails. The book specifically walks you the process of implementing BDD with a BDD tool called cucumber that they recommend. The authors do not make great comparisons with other ruby BDD tools but they do a good job of explaining from first principles how to write acceptance tests with cucumber for a rails applications. 
+ Implementing CI/CD with semaphore
If you guessed it right, then you probably thought there would be continous integration in this book as well since automated testing is one ofthe pre-requistes of continous integration and continous deployment. The book explains how to implement a continous integration and continous deployment pipeline with an online CI tool called semaphore
+ Abit of unit testing with Rspec
There is also some examples on unit testing with Rspec which is not in great details but references good resources on the subject for the reader to explore further.

## My conclusion

This is a book that gives you content as promised from its title. What you see in the title is what you get in the content. It explains more of BDD with elaborate examples which is all you need to know if you are interested in the subject. The biggest catch is the fact that the semaphore authors are sharing from their experience as a team which in essence anyone using ruby on rails will relate. 

I therefore can give it a 4.99/5 rating for clear, precise, elaborate and practical explanation on rails testing. Leaving out the 0.001 so that I agree with anyone that may have useful criticism for this ebook.
